# Deploy K8s cluster
### Overview
Run the `./k8s-deploy.sh` to deploy a cluster in the devops sandbox AWS account. Some variables will need to be changed in order to work for you. The cluster is loosely based on the dev cluster at around Dec '18

Run the `./k8s-setup.sh` to setup the cluster with the ops namespace and install helm/tiller.
